# Methoductor, curriculum builder

One of the biggest pain in my career. We had a huge expertise in instructional design and wanted to pack into service, which helps people without educational experience to create engaging educational programs and curriculums.

We've spent 1,5 years on it, lots of money, but couldn't find market fit, so we had to close this project.
