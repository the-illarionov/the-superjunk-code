# Mas-wrestling game

WebRTC-based game for scrablle-like game in the setting of mas-wrestling. At first, i wanted to make it without any frameworks and build own reactive system, graphics manager etc. But it resulted in lots of bugs, so i dropped it and decided to right from scratch on Vue.

But it still was very fun to tackle with WebRTC.
