# The Superjunk Code

It is a collection of all my code written for 6 years as a CTO of my startup.

Some of it is not fully working, some is spaghetti-code. I made this repo just to demonstrate my knowledge of stack. Right now i write far better code and architecture and to prove it i'm refactoring some of this (actually, mas-wrestlng-game and course-builder are currently in the work).
